Companion repository for presentation "Powerhauling Data With Powershell" by Kim Berg Hansen.

You can find the presentation with explanations here: https://bit.ly/powerhauling

This repository contains the scripts and associated objects for the demos in the presentation. If you are inspired to use the code from the scripts, the responsibility is your own.

All of these scripts are tested in Powershell 7 (.NET Core) - the ones using SimplySql with SimplySql 2.0.4.75.

Read the presentation for overall explanation/description. Read the comments in each script for technical details.
