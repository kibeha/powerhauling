# powerhauling
Companion repository for presentation "Powerhauling Data With Powershell" by Kim Berg Hansen.

You can find the presentation with explanations here: https://bit.ly/powerhaul

This repository contains the scripts and associated objects for the demos in the presentation. If you are inspired to use the code from the scripts, the responsibility is your own.

Most of these scripts are tested in Powershell 7 (.NET Core), except number 9, 10 and 20 that need Powershell 5 for using SimplySql.

Read the presentation for overall explanation/description. Read the comments in each script for technical details.
